Question 5: What is the average, minimum, and maximum ratings given to "Memory versus Pointing" game? (Your answer should be 3.5584, 0, and 9, respectively)
%sql SELECT test_name, AVG(rating) AS AVG_R, MAX(rating) AS MAX_R, MIN(rating) AS MIN_R FROM reviews WHERE test_name='Memory versus Pointing';

Question 6: How would you query how much time it took to complete each test provided in the exam_answers table, in minutes? Title the column that represents this data "Duration.
%sql SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time,end_time) AS duration FROM exam_answers LIMIT 1000;

Question 7: Include a column for Dog_Guid, start_time, and end_time in your query, and examine the output. Do you notice anything strange?
%sql SELECT dog_guid, start_time, end_time, TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time,end_time) AS duration FROM exam_answers LIMIT 1000;

Question 8: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete all of the tests in the exam_answers table, if you do not exclude any data (the answer will be approximately 587 minutes)?
%sql SELECT * FROM exam_answers LIMIT 1;

Question 9: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete the "Treat Warm-Up" test, according to the exam_answers table (about 165 minutes, if no data is excluded)?
%sql SELECT test_name, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time)) AS AVG_T FROM exam_answers WHERE test_name='Treat Warm-UP';

Question 10: How many possible test names are there in the exam_answers table?
%sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT test_name) FROM exam_answers;

Question 11: What is the minimum and maximum value in the Duration column of your query that included the data from the entire table?
%sql SELECT  MAX(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time)) AS MAX_T, MIN(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time)) AS MIN_T FROM exam_answers ;

Question 12: How many of these negative Duration entries are there? (the answer should be 620)
%sql SELECT COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time)) AS duration FROM exam_answers WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time) <0; 

Question 13: How would you query all the columns of all the rows that have negative durations so that you could examine whether they share any features that might give you clues about what caused the entry mistake?
%sql SELECT dog_guid, start_time, end_time, TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time) AS durations FROM exam_answers WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time, end_time)<0;

Question 14: What is the average amount of time it took customers to complete all of the tests in the exam_answers table when the negative durations are excluded from your calculation (you should get 11233 minutes)?
%sql SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time)) AS legi_duration FROM exam_answers WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time)>0;
