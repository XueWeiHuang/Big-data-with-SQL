Question 1: How would you change the title of the "start_time" field in the exam_answers table to "exam start time" in a query output?
%sql SELECT start_time as 'exam start time' FROM exam_answers LIMIT 1;
Question 2: How would you list all the possible combinations of test names and subcategory names in complete_tests table? (If you do not limit your output, you should retrieve 45 possible combinations)
%sql SELECT DISTINCt test_name, subcategory_name FROM complete_tests;
Question 3: Below, try executing a query that would sort the same output as described above by membership_type first in descending order, and state second in ascending order:
%sql SELECT DISTINCT breed, REPLACE (breed, '-', '') AS breed_fixed FROM dogs ORDER BY breed_fixed;
Question 4: How would you get a list of all the subcategories of Dognition tests, in alphabetical order, with no test listed more than once (if you do not limit your output, you should retrieve 16 rows)?
Question 5: How would you create a text file with a list of all the non-United States countries of Dognition customers with no country listed more than once?
non_US = %sql SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users WHERE country !="US";
non_US.csv('non_US.csv').
Question 6: How would you find the User ID, Dog ID, and test name of the first 10 tests to ever be completed in the Dognition database?
%sql SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, dog_guid, test_name FROM complete_tests ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 10;
Question 7: How would create a text file with a list of all the customers with yearly memberships who live in the state of North Carolina (USA) and joined Dognition after March 1, 2014, sorted so that the most recent member is at the top of the list?
greater_2014 = %sql SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, state, country, created_at FROM users WHERE country='US' AND state='NC' AND membership_type >= 2 AND created_at>'2014-03-01' ORDER by created_at DESC;
greater_2014.csv('greater_2014.csv')
Question 8: See if you can find an SQL function from the list provided at:
